Initial release.

* Single-snapshot quality checks: QC-01 to QC-14 (missing rate, empty columns,
  duplicate rows, row/column counts, inferred types, numeric stats, distinct
  counts, allowed values, numeric bounds, non-numeric rate, key uniqueness,
  regex pattern, minimum row count) and SC-01/SC-02 (schema contract).
* Version comparison checks: CP-01 to CP-08 (row count change, schema diff,
  missing rate change, numeric mean shift, new/dropped distinct values,
  non-numeric rate change, column order).
* Custom organisation-specific checks via a plain R file.
* Self-contained HTML report with check tables, historical trend charts, and
  column statistics appendix.
* SQLite snapshot database for long-term trend tracking.
